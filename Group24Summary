Weather-Matic 3000 Java Application Summary

The Weather App is a tool for people who want a simple, quick way to find the best day to do a certain outdoor activity.
This app draws from two weather service API's; Weather Underground and the National Weather Service. 
Weather information is collected based on the user's selected location(s), and is then matched against preset parameters for the user's chosen activity.
The app will then return information about the top three days to go in the following week for both of the API's based on the activity's parameters.
While the app is complete in terms of what was planned for the school project, future functionality will include the ability to add more activities and adjust the parameters for each activity among other things.
