Welcome to WeatherMatic 3000! To begin, please ensure you setup your Eclipse environment correctly for optimal results:

1. Please setup your Java build path to use JRE System Library [jdk-13.0.2]
2. Please add JUnit 5 to the classpath
3. Please also add json-20190722.jar to the classpath as well
	3a. This can be done by downloading the jar following the instructions here: https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java
	3b. Once done, go to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Classpath > Add External Jars... this will prompt you to find the .jar file adn add it to your classpath
4. This project is still under construction, you can run the program and see a temporary output using an existing list of locations. If you create a sub-folder called SavedSearches and place the 3 json files from piazza in it, you can actually call the weather forecast.
